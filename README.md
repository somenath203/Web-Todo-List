# Web-Todo-List
This is a basic Web Based Todo List app created using bootstrap and flask


## Requirements
You must make sure sure that you have python version 3.9.1+ installed in your system.

## Setup

Open any independent or IDE Based Terminal.

Then, navigate to that directory where you have downloaded the repository by using `cd directory-name` 


Then, inside the same terminal, write
```
cd Web-Todo-List
```


Then, after entering inside `Web-Todo-List` directory, we need to install flask.


To install flask, write 
```
pip install flask
```


## Running the Server

After installing flask, write

```
python app.py
```
Now, the server will start running.

After running the server, you will get a localhost url link in the terminal for eg. http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Copy the link from the terminal and paste it in the browser and press enter key to open the Web Todo List.
