# Web-Todo-List
This is a basic Web Based Todo List app created using bootstrap and flask. With this Web Based App, the user can create and store as many todo lists as possible. The user also
has the option of updating/editing any added todo list and also the user can delete any added todo list if he/she wants.


## Requirements
Python Version 3.9.1+

## Setup

Open any independent or IDE Based Terminal.

Then, navigate to that directory where repository is downloaded by using the command `cd directory-name` 


Then, inside the same terminal, write
```
cd Web-Todo-List
```


Then, after entering inside `Web-Todo-List` directory, we need to install flask.


To install flask, write 
```
pip install flask
```


## Running the Server

After installing flask, write

```
python app.py
```
Now, the server will start running.

After running the server, we will get a localhost url link in the terminal for eg. http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Copy the link from the terminal and paste it in the browser and press enter key to open the Web Todo List.
